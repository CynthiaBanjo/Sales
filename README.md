<p>For the first visual, furniture sales in the East is running at a loss while technology, in comparison with order quantity generates the highest profits.</p>
 <p>The second visual, visualises sales by product category for different region.  It shows that technology supplies in the central has the highest sales while office supplies in the South has the lowest sales.</p>
  <p>The third visual shows trend that furniture is not performing  well. The difference between 2009 and 2012 sales shows that sales is going down. In 2010, it goes up a bit but went down in 2011 and then plunged down in 2012. The rise in 2010 was not significant in comparison to the rate it plunged down in 2011.</p>
 <p> The fourth visual shows sales for different product sub-category filtered by years.
In this visual, under product sub-category, the badly performed products such as rubber bands, labels and scissors rulers might need to be discontinued or do a promotion to encourage sales. 
Office machines is the best seller even though sales went down after 2009. It picked up in 2012. 
Overall, office machines, even while it is going down, it is the best seller of all the products.

<p>In the fifth visual, which has to do with state sales, sales were good in California, but Montana has the lowest sales record in comparison with all the other sales.</p>
<p> The last visual shows Order quantity per region filtered by sales.
The deeper the colour blue, the higher the sales while the lighter the blue, the lower the sales. This show that the Central region has more sales and more order quantity while the South region has lowest sales, and East has lowest order quantity.
